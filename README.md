# DV_NYC_Crime
Tourists and visitors represent a valuable element of many countries. Evidence suggest that being new to the place, tourists and visitors are at a greater risk of being victims of criminal activities. These give an image of insecurity that directly or indirectly affects the decision-making process and the destination choice. Government agencies have resources to identify them, but common people do not have any source to predict such activities. In this project, we assess relationships between various city metrics and the types and patterns of crimes, over time in the New York City.  We have used our knowledge of data visualization to articulate New York Cityâ€™s crime complaints data. The visualization relates places of interest and nearby restaurants which are some of the important locations tourists would be interested. Our project will facilitate people in New York City to visualize criminal activities at a given time and a given place. The user is presented with several visualizations for multiple places of interest, nearby restaurants, comparison charts and single place or restaurant charts with detailed information.
